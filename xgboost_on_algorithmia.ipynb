    "\n",
    "With this notebook, we will be training an XGBoost model on Amazon's Musical Instrument Reviews dataset and be able to use this model to predict the sentiment of the given texts. If you would like to see the final product first, you can check out this algorithm in action at https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/asli/xgboost_basic_sentiment_analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Let's first go over the steps we will cover in this notebook. We will start with the end in mind and then slowly build up to that point. At the end of this demo, you will have an up and running algorithm on [Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com), ready to serve its predictions upon your requests!\n",
    "\n",
    "Step by step, we will: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an algorithm on Algorithmia\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clone the algorithm's repository on our local machine, so that we develop locally \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create the basic algorithm script and the dependencies file. We will code our script in advance, assuming that our model will be sitting on a remote path on Algorithmia and our script will load the model from there. We will then make these assumptions true!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Commit and push these files to Algorithmia and get our Algorithm's container built\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Load the training data\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Preprocess the data\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Setup an XGBoost model and do a mini hyperparameter search\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Fit the data on our model\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Get the predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Check the accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Repeat the steps through 6 and 10 until we are happy with our model :)\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Once we are happy, upload the to Algorithmia and have it up and ready to serve our upcoming prediction requests!\n",
